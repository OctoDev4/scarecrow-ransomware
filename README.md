⚠️ Scarecrow-Ransomware Disclaimer
Scarecrow-Ransomware is a proof-of-concept (PoC) developed solely for educational and research purposes. This simulation is intended to demonstrate how ransomware mechanisms function in a controlled environment and should never be used for malicious or unauthorized activities.

🧪 Purpose
The goal of this project is to help cybersecurity professionals, students, and researchers understand:

The basic structure of ransomware behavior

How encryption and user interaction can be simulated

Defensive strategies and detection mechanisms

🚫 Limitations
This PoC does not include and will not publish:

Any real-world key management infrastructure

Remote administration tools for infected machines

Persistent control mechanisms or actual payload delivery systems

These components are intentionally excluded to prevent misuse and ensure the project remains strictly educational.

📌 Responsibility
Users of this code are fully responsible for how they choose to interact with it. By using or modifying this project, you agree to:

Use it only in isolated lab environments or authorized simulations

Never deploy it against real systems, networks, or individuals

Comply with all applicable laws and ethical guidelines
